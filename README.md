# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering is a systematic approach to develop software through various methodologies and practices to maintain high quality and standards of a software. It differs from traditional programming because traditional programming focuses primarily on coding while software engineering focuses on analysis, design, coding, maintenance and testing of a software.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements specification: This is collecting and gathering the requirements and needs of the user.
2. Software design: This is the process of modelling the software's architecture and its functionality. This can be done through charts such as class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams (ERD).
3. Implementation: This is the process of coding the software, mainly from the designs created from the software design stage.
4. Testing: This is where the software is examined a couple of times in terms of its architecture and funcitonality to identify errors and checking whether it meets the stakeholders needs and requirements.
5. Deployment: This is the stage where the software is released to the consumers for use.
6. Maintenance: This is the stage where advancements or modifications such as upgrading are done after the software is released. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model is an approach where software is developed iteratively, where any phase in the software development process can be carried out at any time promoting flexiblity while waterfall model is an approach where the software is developed in a sequential manner from the first phase to the last.
Key differences:
1. Agile model is an iterative software development technique while waterfall model is a sequential technique.
2. Agile model has testing during the entire development process while waterfall model has testing occuring in the later stages.
Suitability:
Agile model is suitable in projects where there is high uncertainty or where there are rapidly changing requirements while waterfall model is suitable in projects where project's requirements are very specific and well-defined.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is the process of defining, analysing, documenting and maintaining the needs of the stakeholders in a software system. 
It helps ensure the user's needs and expectations of the system are met and also helps in identification of problems and potential issues early during the development process.
Requirement engineering process:
1. Requirement elicitation: This is where the requirements from the stakeholders are gathered, including customers, users, and others who have an interest in the system.
2. Requirement analysis: This is the process where the gathered requirements are evaluated to ensure they are feasible and consistent. The requirments that are vague are dropped or refined.
3. Requirement specification:  This is where the analyzed requirements are documented in a clear and precise manner.
4. Requirement validation: Carried out to ensure the requirements accurately represent the needs of the stakeholders.
5. Requirement management: This is where the requiremnts are maintained and changes to the requirements are managed.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is where a software is divided into separate modules with independent functionality and operation.
Modularity allows software developers to tackle problems in the software one at a time, (bit by bit), making it easier to develop and maintain sections in a software rather than solving the all the problems at once. 
For example, when developing a banking app, it can be divided into loan section, savings and transactions section where developers can focus on each component making design and development easier.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing: This is a form of testing where subcomponents in a software are tested independently to identify errors or test the functionality as a unit.
2. Integration testing: This is a form of testing where the connection between the units(components) in a software and how they work together are tested to identify errors or monitor the flow of data between the components.
3. System testing: This is a form of testing where the software is tested as a whole to make sure it works as a unified whole.
4. Acceptance testing:  This is a form of testing where the system is evaluated to determine whether it meets and complies to the business' and user requirements.

Testing is important in software development because it helps in determining whether the software works as expected, necessary errors are eliminated and the software conforms to the business requirements and complies with regulations and standards that are set.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are systems that are used to track and manage the changes made to a software code.
They are important because they facilitate collaboration on software projects encouraging improvements in the code quality.
They also allow developers to keep track of changes in the code, therefore, mistakes made can be easily reverted.
Examples are: 
1. Git
Features of git:
a. It is free and open source
b. It is scalable
c. Supports collaboration
d. It tracks history of the code.

2. Apache SubVersion
Features of Apache SubVersion:
a. It is centralized 
b. It allows atomic commits. (either all changes in a commit are applied, or none are.)
c. It facilitates directory versioning

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
He/she plans, executes and closes software projects, ensuring that the project's goals are met on time, within the scope and budget.
Responsibilities of a software project manager:
Project planning and scheduling
Resource management, that includes time, personnel and equipment.
Budget and cost management.
Project execution and monitoring.
Documentation and monitoring

Challenges faced in managing software projects:
1. Vague requirements: Initial requirements are often unclear or incomplete leading to misunderstandings and changes later in the project.
2. Time management: Poor estimation of time occurs in software projects where the time set to complete could not be achieved leading to missing deadlines or rushed projects.
3. Difficulty in resource allocation: Managing and allocating the right tools, personnel and technologies to tasks can be an issue.
4. Poor communication, between the software team and the stakeholders leads to misunderstandings.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of making small or large changes to the system after it has been deployed for use to correct faults or improve it's performance.
Types of software maintenance:
1. Adaptive maintenance: This is modifying the software to align with the changes in its environment such as hardware and operating systems. For example modifying a system to work with an updated hardware.
2. Perfective maintenance: Modifying the software to improve its performance or add new features or functionalities. For example, maintaining a software to reduce its loading time.
3. Corrective maintenance: Modifying a software to eliminate bugs or faults that occur in it. For example, correcting a glitch in a software where a page fails to load.
4. Preventive maintenance: Making changes to the software to prevent future problems. This includes activities aimed at increasing the softwareâ€™s reliability and maintainability.

Regular maintenance ensures that the software remains operational and reliable over time. It helps in identifying and fixing bugs that may not have been discovered during the initial development phase.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. Privacy and data protection: This is handling sensitive user data, ensuring it is processed and stored securely.
2. Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity: Particularly those with impairments or from underpriviledged backgrounds.
3. Honesty and integrity: Being truthful about capabilities, limitations, and performance of software.
4. Transparency and accountability: Being transparent about how software operates, especially in critical systems.

Software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards by doing the following:
1. Follow a Code of Ethics
2. Ongoing Education and Training
3. Conduct Thorough Testing and Reviews
4. Seek External Audits and Assessments
